Irasshaimase!
...
Oh, hello! Welcome to Rumble Fish! You're the new server, right?
We've been expecting you. I'm Marcus, one of the chefs here. Nice to meet you!
Lulu's upstairs in her home right now, but she'll be down in a minute. She's our boss.
...
Oh, actually she's here now! Hey Lulu, the new server is here.
You're two minutes late. For someone as mediocre-looking as you, I'd think you would make up for it by at least being punctual.
Now now, Lulu, let's not be too hard on the new guy. I'm sure it's nerve-wracking enough as it is.
I don't care. My restaurant requires extra attention to detail, and I expect everyone here to accomodate accordingly.
Marcus, I'm going back upstairs to rest. Show our newbie the basics and I'll be back later to check up.
Sure thing, Lulu.
I'm sorry about that, our boss has been acting pretty cranky lately. But she's under a lot of pressure, so please be understanding of her!
Well, with all the introductions aside, let's get you started, shall we?
